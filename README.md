# Detect Rage Bait

Detect Rage Bait is a browser extension for X (Twitter) that uses the OpenAI API to analyze accounts and their recent posts, then flags them as **ENGAGE**, **MAYBE**, or **RAGEBAIT**.  
Its goal is to help you spot outrage‑driven, manipulative content in your feed so you can decide what to engage with more intentionally.
